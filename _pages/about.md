**I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science and I direct the [SPECTRAL (the Spatial Computing Education, Training, and Research Lab](https://unb.ca/spectral) and co-direct the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](htps://hci.cs.unb.ca)**, at the [University of New Brunswick](https://www.unb.ca), in [Fredericton, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericton). My research focuses on enabling people to work and play together in new ways, so that we can learn from each other and lead healthier, happier lives. My group's work has included research into mixed reality, game design, computer supported cooperative work, novel interactions, visualization, and serious games for learning and health. 

I joined UNB in 2015, after 2.5 years at the University of Prince Edward Island. I received a PhD and Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from the University of Saskatchewan, and have worked as a researcher with Microsoft Research, IBM Watson Research, the University of Calgary and the National College of Ireland.
